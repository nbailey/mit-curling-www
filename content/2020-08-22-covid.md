The 2020 College Curling National Championship that was originally rescheduled for October has been cancelled, so MIT will remain the reigning bronze medalists for another year. As announced <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/USA-Curling/Features/2020/August/18/College-Curling-Goes-Virtual-for-Fall-Semester?fbclid=IwAR2roQkpBbjVVc0Q9IjCQUXpPn17xvfXsMbUYbzREz0PltRf657DJA8tllo" target="_blank">here</a>, the USA college curling league will be virtual this year (at least for the Fall). We will share more updates as more information on the virtual format becomes available, but in the mean time we will be looking for new MIT curlers to practice their e-curling skills to get ready for a virtual nationals competition! This is a special opportunity to try e-curling on a collegiate level and learn the sport if you could not join our practices before due to time conflicts. If you want to watch professional curling competitions together or just want to hang out with cool people, we would also be glad to have you. You can let us know you're interested (and join the mailing list) by emailing us at curling-owner@mit.edu.
