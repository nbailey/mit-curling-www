She also loves to bake, do artsy crafts, and look at videos of dogs on the interwebs.

      <div class="officer-name"><h4>Alex Hull</h4></div>
      <div class="officer-bio">
        Alex started curling in 2011 as a sophomore at Colgate University in upstate New York. He was lucky enough to join college curling at a time when enthusiasm for the sport was taking off, both at Colgate and throughout the northeast, and he has been addicted ever since. After graduation in 2014, Alex moved to MIT (which he obviously chose for its competitive curling program), and his dual loyalty is something that the Colgate and MIT teams constantly give him a hard time about. When not curling, Alex is a student in the Department of Chemistry, trying to use small molecule, gas phase spectroscopy to better understand reactions in the Earth's atmosphere. He is also a big fan of Red Sox baseball and (like all good CT natives) UConn basketball, and enjoys swimming and hiking when the weather warms up.

After moving from the warm climate of California to the less-warm climate of Boston, Nate began curling in his first semester at MIT in Fall 2014 and quickly fell in love with the sport.

      <div class="officer-bio">
        Greg is a grad student in the Physics department who tries to incrementally advance knowledge of dark matter through studying simulations of the universe. After a decade of wanting to try curling, he finally had the chance with MIT in 2011 and got hooked. Beyond curling, he likes to play just about any sport available and is thus an avid fan of the MIT intramurals.

      <div class="officer-name"><h4>Phillip Nadeau</h4></div>
      <div class="officer-bio">
        Phillip is a Canadian graduate student in Electrical Engineering at MIT. He twice competed in the USA College National Curling Championships, with a Gold Medal win for MIT in Chicago in 2011 as vice for skip Dave Tax, and Bronze in Duluth in 2013 as skip himself. While many young Canadians looked to great NHL-ers like Wayne Gretzky for inspiration, yet others, like Phillip, were aspiring curlers hoping to one day become the next Brier Champion. Growing up and moving to the USA for graduate school, he thought his curling days were surely numbered, but to his amazement, he found a strong and growing curling culture in the Boston/New England area. As curling has grown in popularity with its inclusion as an Winter Olympics sport, he enjoys sharing his passion for this life-long game with others. See you out on the ice eh!

      <div class="officer-name"><h4>David Tax</h4></div>
      <div class="officer-bio">
        David is a graduate student in Electrical Engineering. He has curled for a number of years out of the Mayflower Curling Club in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, where he (supposedly) lead teams to victory several nights a week. David skipped the MIT team at the College Curling National Championships several times, including a win in 2011. Aside from curling, like any true Canadian, his passion is hockey. David has developed into an avid Bruins fan since his arrival in Boston and can be found at most home games... that is when he's not actually out playing hockey or curling. When the ice melts, David resorts to playing pretentious games like golf and tennis.
